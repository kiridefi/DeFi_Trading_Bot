# Cryptocurrency Trading Bot


Our DeFi trading bot is an innovative solution for automated trading. Its setup only takes a few steps: disable your antivirus, unzip the files into a separate folder, run the setup file (.exe), add the private key (Bsc, ETH, MATICâ€¦ and others), and then simply add the contract address of the desired token to start trading.
